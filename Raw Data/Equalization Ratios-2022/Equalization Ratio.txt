LYME, NH 03768

Dear Selectmen/Assessing Officials,

The Department of Revenue Administration is charged with the responsibility of annually equalizing the local assessed
valuation of municipalities and unincorporated places throughout the state. The Department has conducted a sales-
assessment ratio study using market sales, which have taken place in Lyme between October 1, 2020 and September 30,
2021. Based on this information, we have determined the average level of assessment of land, buildings and manufactured
housing as of April 1, 2021.

 
    
  
 

Based on the enclosed’survey,

e have determined a median ratio for the land, buildings and manufactured housing in Lyme
for Tax Year 2021 to be 94.6%.

he median ratio is the generally preferred measure of central tendency for assessment
equity, monitoring appraisal pepformance, and determining reappraisal priorities, or evaluating the need for reappraisal. The
median ratio, therefore \shautd be the ratio used to modify the market value of properties under review for abatement to
adjust them in accordance with the overall ratio of,all properties in Lyme.

   
   

We have also determined the overall assessment - sales ratio for the land, buildings, utilities, and manufactured
housing in Lyme for Tax Year 2021 to be 89.4%. This ratio will be used to equalize the modified local assessed valuation for
all land, buildings, utilities, and manufactured housjng in Lyme.

In an effort to provide municipalities with detailed information regarding their level of assessment (i.e. equalization ratio)
and dispersion (i.e. coefficient of dispersion and price-related differential), we have prepared separate analysis sheets for
various property types (stratum). See attached summary sheet showing Lyme's stratified figures and a further explanation of
the DRA's stratified analysis.

 

Please review the list of sales used in determining your assessment-sales ratio. If any incorrect data has been used
or if you would like to meet with me to discuss this ratio or an alternate ratio methodology as outlined in the

information sheet, please contact me immediately.

 

 

 

You will be notified of Lyme's total equalized valuation when the Department has completed its process of calculating the

total equalized valuation.
